Build a mobile-first sleep diary PWA (Progressive Web App) optimized for iPhone Safari "Add to Home Screen". 

## Auth
Use simple persistent local storage with optional PIN lock — no email/password sign-up. Data should persist across sessions without re-authentication.

## Design Direction
This should feel like a well-made instrument, not a consumer health app.

- **Aesthetic**: Minimal, typographic, monochromatic. Think Braun, not Headspace. No illustrations, no emoji, no gradients, no card-heavy layouts.
- **Palette**: True dark background (#0A0A0A or similar), with a single muted accent color (e.g. warm amber or cool slate blue) used sparingly for interactive elements only. White/light grey text with clear hierarchy.
- **Typography**: Use a single clean sans-serif (Inter or SF Pro). Establish clear hierarchy through weight and size, not color. Numbers should feel prominent — this is a data app.
- **Layout**: Generous whitespace. Left-aligned. No visual clutter. Every screen should feel calm.
- **Interactions**: Smooth transitions, no janky animations. Everything should feel responsive and weighted.
- **Time pickers**: Use native `<input type="time">` to trigger iOS's built-in drum roller — do NOT build custom JavaScript time pickers. The native picker is faster, more accessible, and feels right.
- **Toggles and steppers**: Simple, tactile. Large enough to tap without precision. Toggles should have a subtle animation.
- **Overall principle**: If it looks like it could be a medical device interface, you're on the right track. If it looks like it belongs on Product Hunt, strip it back.

## Daily Sleep Log Entry
Default date: yesterday. Allow selecting past dates for backfilling.

### Time Capture (priority: speed of entry)
Native iOS time pickers for all time fields:
- **Bedtime** (time I got into bed)
- **Sleep time** (time I estimate I fell asleep)
- **Wake time** (final wake-up)
- **Night wakings**: tap "+" to add wake periods with start/end times
- **Nap** (optional): single start/end time

### Auto-calculated fields (displayed prominently):
- **Time in bed** = wake time - bedtime
- **Total sleep** = time in bed - (sleep latency) - (total night waking time)
- **Sleep efficiency** = (total sleep / time in bed) × 100%
- Add nap duration separately, show adjusted total

### Other daily fields:
- **Drinks** (alcohol): number stepper (0-10+)
- **Weed**: toggle (yes/no)
- **Insights**: toggle (yes/no) — flag for notable observations
- **Next-day feeling**: 1-5 scale
- **Notes**: free text field

## Dashboard
- Weekly/monthly summary view
- Average sleep duration, efficiency, and feeling score
- Trends: correlate drinks/weed with sleep quality and next-day feeling
- Simple, clean charts — thin lines, no fills, minimal gridlines

## Data Export
- Export all entries as CSV including all raw fields plus calculated fields (total sleep, sleep efficiency)
- Allow filtering export by date range
- Trigger the iOS Share sheet so I can email, AirDrop, or save to Files directly

## Technical requirements
- PWA with offline support and service worker
- All data stored locally (localStorage or IndexedDB)
- Large touch targets throughout — this is used half-asleep
