## Sleep Diary App — Interface Design Brief

### Context
This is a personal sleep diary used daily on iPhone. The primary interaction happens first thing in the morning when the user is barely awake — logging last night's sleep. The secondary interaction is reviewing patterns over time from the dashboard. Every design decision should serve one of these two moments.

### Design Philosophy
This is not a wellness app. It's a personal instrument — closer to a pilot's logbook or a well-designed cycling computer than anything in the health app store. It should feel confident, opinionated, and slightly beautiful. Form serves function, but form still matters.

### Visual Language

**Color System — Functional, Not Decorative**
Color defines zones, not moods. Each section of the entry form occupies a distinct color territory so the user can navigate by feel:

- **Sleep zone** (bedtime, sleep time, wake time): Deep indigo/navy. This is the core of the app and should feel like night.
- **Disruption zone** (night wakings): A cooler, lighter shift — slate or muted blue-grey. Visually "lighter sleep."
- **Substance zone** (drinks, weed): Warm amber/ochre. Distinct from the sleep palette. Signals a different category of input.
- **Reflection zone** (feeling score, notes, insights): Soft warm neutral — off-white or warm grey. This is the morning, waking up.
- **Calculated metrics** (total sleep, efficiency): These float above the form in a persistent or summary strip. High contrast. The sleep total is the hero number on the page — largest type, most prominent position.

Background should be dark but not pure black — something like #0D1117 (a very dark blue-black) that has warmth and depth.

**Typography**
One typeface family only. A humanist or geometric sans-serif with excellent numerals — numbers are the primary content of this app and should look beautiful at large sizes. Use weight and size aggressively for hierarchy:
- Hero metrics: extra-large, medium weight
- Input labels: small, uppercase, tracked out, low opacity
- Values: large, full opacity
- Notes/secondary: standard body size

**Layout Principles**

*Entry Screen:*
Structured as a vertical narrative — a story of the night told top to bottom:
1. **Date** (prominent, defaults to yesterday, tappable to change)
2. **The Night** — bedtime, sleep time, wake time in a tight cluster. These three are always visible.
3. **Disruptions** — night wakings, collapsed by default, expand with a "+" tap. Each waking is a start/end pair.
4. **Nap** — optional, collapsed by default.
5. **Metrics strip** — calculated totals appear here, updating live as times are entered. Total sleep is the hero. Efficiency percentage beside it.
6. **Factors** — drinks stepper, weed toggle, insights toggle. Horizontal row, compact.
7. **How I feel** — 1-5 scale. Large tappable targets. Could be numbered blocks or a segmented bar.
8. **Notes** — free text, expandable. Starts as a single line.
9. **Save** — single prominent button, bottom of scroll.

Group related inputs tightly — they should feel like instrument clusters, not a form. Generous spacing *between* groups, tight spacing *within* groups.

*Dashboard:*
This is the reward screen. It should feel like opening a beautifully designed report.
- Default to weekly view, toggle to monthly
- Hero stat up top: average sleep this period, with trend arrow
- Average efficiency, average feeling score alongside
- Chart: sleep duration over time as a clean bar or area chart. Thin, elegant, not chunky.
- Correlation overlays: ability to see drinks/weed nights marked on the sleep chart so patterns are visible at a glance
- Use the same color zones from the entry form so there's visual continuity — amber dots for drinking nights, etc.

### Interaction Qualities
- **Time pickers**: Native iOS inputs. No custom JavaScript wheels.
- **Toggles**: Generous hit targets. Subtle color shift on state change. Should be satisfying to tap.
- **Stepper** (drinks): Tap +/- with the number large and central. Maybe allow tap-and-hold for fast increment.
- **Transitions**: Smooth, quick, no bounce or overshoot. Expanding sections should ease in, not snap.
- **Save feedback**: Brief, confident — a checkmark or subtle flash, not a modal or celebration.

### What This Should NOT Look Like
- No rounded pastel cards floating on grey backgrounds
- No emoji or illustrations anywhere
- No gratuitous animations or confetti
- No "streaks" or gamification language
- No onboarding carousel
- No gradient buttons
- Nothing that looks like it was made from a Tailwind UI template without modification

### Reference Touchpoints
- The data density of a Garmin cycling computer
- The typography confidence of the Nomos Glashütte website
- The color-as-information approach of a Bloomberg terminal (but beautiful)
- The restraint of Teenage Engineering product design
